What started as an ambitious one-day hackathon ended with our team taking home not just 1st place, but also the "Best Use Case of Redis" award. [Allie](/allie-jones), [Gina](/gina-levy), and [Sarah](/sarah-graup) came together to build something that would push the boundaries of AI agents and modern web architecture - and walked away with $5,000 in AWS credits and $1,000 from Redis.

## The Challenge: Building AI Agents in One Day

The [MCP - AI Agents Hackathon](https://luma.com/8c6n3rn2?tk=Oo5gGN) brought together San Francisco's brightest developers for one intense day of building cutting-edge AI applications. With $50K+ in prizes and sponsors like Anthropic, Redis, Stytch, and more, the competition was fierce.

The challenge? Build AI agents that push the limits of LLMs and AI applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Pitch Scoop: Reimagining Pitch Competitions

Our winning solution, **Pitch Scoop**, tackles a real problem in the startup ecosystem: the inefficiency and subjectivity of traditional pitch competitions.

### The Vision

Pitch Scoop is an AI-powered pitch competition platform that transforms how startups present their ideas and how investors evaluate them. Instead of relying solely on human judgment, our platform uses sophisticated AI analysis to provide objective, data-driven insights.

### Technical Architecture

We built Pitch Scoop with a modern, scalable architecture:

**Backend Stack:**
- **FastAPI**: Lightning-fast Python web framework for our API
- **Redis + RedisVL**: High-performance caching, real-time data processing, and vector database (our Redis implementation was so impressive it won us the "Best Use Case" award)
- **MinIO**: Object storage for handling pitch decks, videos, and media files
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data

**AI Integration:**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Seamless AI assistant interactions
- **Multi-model AI analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of pitch content
- **Real-time scoring**: Instant feedback on presentation quality

**Architecture Principles:**
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Supporting multiple competition organizers
- **Event-driven architecture**: Real-time updates and notifications

### Why Redis Made the Difference

Our Redis implementation went far beyond simple caching. We leveraged Redis and RedisVL for:

1. **Real-time Leaderboards**: Instant updates as pitches are scored
2. **Session Management**: Fast, secure user authentication
3. **Caching Layer**: Sub-millisecond response times for AI analysis results
4. **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Real-time notifications to judges and participants
5. **Rate Limiting**: Preventing abuse of our AI analysis endpoints
6. **Vector Database**: RedisVL for semantic search and AI-powered pitch similarity analysis

## Why We Built MCP-First: The Strategic Decision

While many teams at the hackathon treated MCP as just another API to integrate, we made a strategic decision to build Pitch Scoop as an **MCP-first application**. This wasn't just about using the protocol - it was about fundamentally architecting our system around the capabilities that MCP enables.

### The MCP-First Philosophy

Traditional AI integrations follow a request-response pattern: send data to AI, get results back, display to user. This approach treats AI as an external service rather than an integral part of your application's intelligence.

MCP-first development inverts this relationship. Instead of your application calling AI, intelligent agents become active participants in your system's core workflows. They maintain context, make autonomous decisions, and collaborate with other agents to solve complex problems.

### Why This Mattered for Pitch Scoop

Pitch competitions involve multiple interconnected workflows:
- **Participants** submit pitches and need real-time feedback
- **Judges** evaluate presentations with varying expertise levels
- **Organizers** manage competitions with different criteria
- **AI agents** analyze content across multiple dimensions simultaneously

In a traditional architecture, we'd build separate systems for each user type and bolt on AI features. With MCP-first design, our intelligent agents become the connective tissue that makes all these workflows seamlessly interact.

### MCP-First Architectural Benefits

#### 1. Context Persistence Across Sessions
Unlike stateless API calls, our MCP agents maintain context about:
- Individual participant improvement over time
- Judge preferences and scoring patterns  
- Competition-specific evaluation criteria
- Historical performance data for predictive insights

#### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Different specialized agents work together:
```python path=null start=null
# Specialized agents collaborating via MCP
class PitchEcosystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content_agent = ContentAnalysisAgent()  # Evaluates pitch content
        self.presentation_agent = PresentationAgent()  # Analyzes delivery
        self.market_agent = MarketAnalysisAgent()  # Assesses business viability
        self.coordinator = AgentCoordinator()  # Orchestrates collaboration
    
    async def comprehensive_analysis(self, pitch_data):
        # Agents share context and build on each other's insights
        content_insights = await self.content_agent.analyze(pitch_data)
        presentation_insights = await self.presentation_agent.analyze(
            pitch_data, content_context=content_insights
        )
        market_insights = await self.market_agent.analyze(
            pitch_data, 
            content_context=content_insights,
            presentation_context=presentation_insights
        )
        
        return await self.coordinator.synthesize_insights(
            content_insights, presentation_insights, market_insights
        )
```

#### 3. Real-Time Adaptive Intelligence
Our MCP agents don't just analyze - they learn and adapt:
- **During competitions**: Agents adjust scoring based on judge feedback patterns
- **Between sessions**: System learns from successful pitch characteristics
- **Across competitions**: Insights from one event improve analysis for future events

#### 4. Seamless Human-AI Collaboration
Judges don't feel like they're "using an AI tool" - they experience intelligent assistance that:
- Surfaces relevant insights at the right moments
- Asks clarifying questions when analysis is uncertain
- Provides contextual suggestions without being intrusive
- Learns from judge preferences to personalize future interactions

### The Implementation Advantage

Building MCP-first gave us significant advantages during the hackathon:

**Speed of Development**: Instead of building separate AI integration points, we designed one intelligent system that serves all user types.

**Natural User Experience**: Users interact with intelligence, not interfaces. The AI feels embedded in the workflow rather than bolted on.

**Scalable Architecture**: Adding new AI capabilities means creating new agents that plug into our existing MCP framework, not rebuilding integration points.

**Real-Time Intelligence**: Our agents maintain state and context, enabling truly real-time intelligent responses rather than batch processing.

### Why This Won the Competition

The judges recognized that our MCP-first approach wasn't just technically impressive - it solved real problems that traditional AI integrations couldn't address:

1. **Consistent Intelligence**: All users benefit from the same high-quality AI analysis, adapted to their specific needs and context.

2. **Learning System**: Unlike static AI features, our platform gets smarter with every interaction and competition.

3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Multiple AI agents working together provide richer insights than any single model could achieve.

4. **Future-Proof Architecture**: As new AI models and capabilities emerge, our MCP-first design makes it trivial to integrate them.

### The Broader Implications

Our success with MCP-first development at the hackathon validates a larger trend: the future of AI applications isn't about adding AI features to existing software - it's about building software around AI's unique capabilities from day one.

MCP provides the protocol layer that makes this possible, enabling developers to create truly AI-native applications where intelligence isn't a feature - it's the foundation.

```python path=null start=null
# Real-time leaderboard updates
async def update_leaderboard(competition_id: str, scores: Dict):
    redis_key = f"leaderboard:{competition_id}"
    pipeline = redis.pipeline()
    
    for participant_id, score in scores.items():
        pipeline.zadd(redis_key, {participant_id: score})
    
    await pipeline.execute()
    
    # Publish update to subscribers
    await redis.publish(f"updates:{competition_id}", 
                       json.dumps({"type": "leaderboard_update", 
                                 "data": scores}))
```

### MCP Agent Integration
Our AI agents use the Model Context Protocol for seamless interaction:

```python path=null start=null
# MCP agent for pitch analysis
class PitchAnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self, mcp_client):
        self.mcp_client = mcp_client
        
    async def analyze_pitch(self, pitch_content: str) -> AnalysisResult:
        context = {
            "type": "pitch_analysis",
            "content": pitch_content,
            "criteria": self.scoring_criteria
        }
        
        return await self.mcp_client.process(context)
```
