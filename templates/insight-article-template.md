HEADING HELP:
# H1 - Main title (use only once per article)
## H2 - Major sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Minor subsections
##### H5 - Rarely used
###### H6 - Rarely used

Keep headings descriptive and scannable. Use sentence case, not title case.
-->

## Introduction Section

Write your compelling introduction here. This should hook the reader and clearly state what they'll learn from this article.

<!-- 
PARAGRAPH HELP:
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences for web readability
- Use active voice when possible
- Start with your strongest points
- End paragraphs with a transition to the next idea
-->

**Bold text** is used for emphasis on key terms and concepts.
*Italic text* is used for subtle emphasis or introducing new terminology.
***Bold italic text*** combines both for maximum emphasis (use sparingly).

<!-- 
TEXT FORMATTING HELP:
**bold** or __bold__ - Use for key terms, important concepts
*italic* or _italic_ - Use for emphasis, book titles, foreign words
***bold italic*** or ___bold italic___ - Use very sparingly for critical points
~~strikethrough~~ - Use for corrections or showing changes
`inline code` - Use for code snippets, file names, technical terms
-->

## Lists and Organization

### Unordered Lists
Use bullet points for non-sequential information:

- First important point
- Second key insight
  - Sub-point with additional detail
  - Another supporting detail
- Third main point

<!-- 
LIST HELP:
Unordered lists (bullets):
- Use hyphens (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+)
- Indent with 2 spaces for sub-items
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Use for non-sequential information

Ordered lists (numbers):
1. Use for step-by-step instructions
2. Or for ranked information
3. Numbers auto-increment
   1. Sub-items use indented numbers
   2. Maintain consistent indentation
-->

### Ordered Lists
Use numbers for sequential steps or ranked information:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with more detail
   1. Sub-step for clarification
   2. Additional sub-step
3. Final step

### Task Lists
Use for actionable items:

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Another task to complete

<!-- 
TASK LIST HELP:
- [x] Completed checkbox
- [ ] Empty checkbox
- Use for actionable items, checklists, progress tracking
-->

## Quotes and Citations

### Blockquotes

> This is a standard blockquote. Use for highlighting important insights, customer testimonials, or key concepts that deserve special attention.

<!-- 
BLOCKQUOTE HELP:
> Single line blockquote
>
> Multi-paragraph blockquotes
> need empty lines with just >

Use blockquotes for:
- Important insights or key takeaways
- Customer testimonials
- Quotes from interviews or sources
- Highlighting contrarian or surprising points
-->

> **Pro Tip:** You can combine formatting within blockquotes for added emphasis.
> 
> This creates multi-paragraph quotes that stand out from regular text.

### Nested Blockquotes

> Main quote or insight
> 
> > Nested quote within the main quote
> 
> Back to the main quote level

## Code and Technical Content

### Inline Code
Use `backticks` for inline code, file names like `config.json`, or technical terms like `localStorage.getItem()`.

<!-- 
Note: Following user preference to never use localStorage.getItem('access_token') in examples
-->

### Code Blocks

```javascript path=null start=null
// Example JavaScript code block
function createInsightArticle(title, content) {
    return {
        title: title,
        content: content,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        author: 'Your Name'
    };
}

// This is hypothetical code for demonstration
const article = createInsightArticle('My Title', 'My content');
```

<!-- 
CODE BLOCK HELP:
```language path=file_path start=line_number
code goes here
```

For real code from files:
```javascript path=/Users/me/project/src/index.ts start=25
// actual code from file
```

For example/hypothetical code:
```javascript path=null start=null
// example code
```

Supported languages: javascript, typescript, python, html, css, bash, sql, json, yaml, etc.
-->

```bash path=null start=null
# Example bash commands
npm install
npm run build
docker-compose up -d
```

```typescript path=null start=null
// TypeScript example (following user preference for TypeScript frontend)
interface InsightArticle {
    title: string;
    author: string;
    publishDate: Date;
    categories: string[];
    featured: boolean;
}

const article: InsightArticle = {
    title: "My Insight Article",
    author: "Author Name", 
    publishDate: new Date(),
    categories: ["AI", "Development"],
    featured: true
};
```

## Links and References

### Basic Links
[Link text](https://example.com) - Standard link format
[Internal link](/insights/another-article) - Link to other pages
[Link with title](https://example.com "This appears on hover") - Link with tooltip

<!-- 
LINK HELP:
[text](url) - Basic link
[text](url "title") - Link with hover tooltip
[text](relative-path) - Internal site links
[text](#heading-id) - Link to heading within same page
[text][reference] - Reference-style link (define reference at bottom)

For external links, consider if they should open in new tabs (handled by your site's JavaScript)
-->

### Reference Links
You can use reference-style links for cleaner text: [Example Site][example] or [Another Reference][ref2].

[example]: https://example.com "Example site tooltip"
[ref2]: https://another-example.com

### Automatic Links
<https://example.com> - Automatic link formatting
<email@example.com> - Automatic email links

## Images and Media

### Basic Image
![Alt text describing the image](/insights/images/example-image.png)

<!-- 
IMAGE HELP:
![alt text](image-path)
![alt text](image-path "title text")

Alt text is crucial for:
- Accessibility (screen readers)
- SEO optimization
- When images fail to load

Always include thumbnails per user preference
Image paths should be relative to your site root
-->

### Image with Title
![Detailed alt text for accessibility](/insights/images/example-with-title.png "This text appears on hover")

### Linked Images
[![Alt text for linked image](/insights/images/clickable-image.png)](https://destination-url.com)

## Advanced Elements

### Tables

| Feature | Description | Priority | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| User Authentication | First party cookies (per user preference) | High | âœ… Complete |
| Database | PostgreSQL implementation | High | âœ… Complete |
| Frontend | TypeScript development | Medium | ðŸ”„ In Progress |
| Docker Setup | Ports 3000 (frontend) & 8000 (backend) | Low | ðŸ“‹ Planned |

<!-- 
TABLE HELP:
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More     |
| Row 2    | Data     | More     |

Alignment options:
|:--------|  Left-aligned
|--------:| Right-aligned  
|:-------:| Center-aligned

Use tables for:
- Comparing features or options
- Displaying structured data
- Creating simple layouts
Keep tables simple - complex data might need different formatting
-->

### Horizontal Rules
Use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores for section breaks:

---

### Line Breaks and Spacing
End a line with two spaces  
to create a line break without starting a new paragraph.

Leave blank lines between paragraphs for proper spacing.

## Sidebar Elements (Obsidian-specific)

### Callout Boxes

> [!note]
> This is a note callout. Use for additional information that supports your main content.

> [!tip]
> This is a tip callout. Use for helpful advice or best practices.

> [!warning]
> This is a warning callout. Use for important caveats or potential issues.

> [!info]

-->

### Collapsible Sections

<details>
<summary>Click to expand this section</summary>

Hidden content goes here. This is useful for:
- Detailed technical explanations
- Optional deep-dive information  
- FAQ answers
- Code examples that might clutter the main text

You can include any markdown formatting inside collapsible sections.

```javascript path=null start=null
// Even code blocks work inside details
console.log('This code is hidden by default');
```

</details>

<!-- 
COLLAPSIBLE HELP:
<details>
<summary>Visible title/summary</summary>
Hidden content here
</details>

Great for:
- Optional technical details
- Long code examples
- FAQ sections
- Reducing visual clutter
-->

## Iframe Embeds

### YouTube Video Embed
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Custom Iframe
<iframe src="https://example.com" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" title="Embedded content description"></iframe>

<!-- 
IFRAME HELP:
<iframe src="URL" width="WIDTH" height="HEIGHT" frameborder="0" title="DESCRIPTION"></iframe>

Key attributes:

## Special Characters and Escaping

### Characters that need escaping:
To display these literally, add a backslash before them:
\* \_ \# \[ \] \( \) \` \~ \| \\

### HTML Entities:
&copy; - Copyright symbol
&trade; - Trademark symbol  
&reg; - Registered trademark
&amp; - Ampersand
&lt; - Less than
&gt; - Greater than

<!-- 
ESCAPING HELP:
Use backslash (\) before special markdown characters to display them literally:
\* \_ \# \[ \] \( \) \` \~ \| \\

HTML entities for special symbols:
&copy; &trade; &reg; &amp; &lt; &gt; &nbsp;
-->

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote reference[^1].

You can also use named footnotes[^note-name] for better organization.

Multiple references to the same footnote work too[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content. It will appear at the bottom of the document.
[^note-name]: Named footnotes are easier to manage in long documents.

<!-- 
FOOTNOTE HELP:
In text: [^identifier]
At bottom: [^identifier]: Footnote content

Identifiers can be:
- Numbers: [^1], [^2]
- Names: [^note-name], [^important]
- Any text: [^this-is-valid-too]

Footnotes automatically:
- Appear at document bottom
- Are numbered sequentially
- Include back-links to references
-->

## Math Expressions (if supported)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n
$$

<!-- 
MATH HELP (requires MathJax or similar):
Inline: $equation$
Block: $$equation$$

Use for mathematical formulas, equations, or scientific notation
Syntax follows LaTeX math formatting
-->

## Conclusion

This template covers all the major markdown elements you'll need for creating engaging insight articles. Remember to:

### Content Best Practices:
- **Start strong** with a compelling hook
- **Use subheadings** to break up long sections  
- **Include visuals** - always add thumbnails per your preference
- **End with action** - clear next steps for readers

### Technical Considerations:
- Follow your preferences: TypeScript for frontend, PostgreSQL for database
- Use Docker ports 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend)
- Never commit .env files to version control
- All validations run in pre-push hooks
- Never bypass pre-commits or use --no-verify

### SEO and Accessibility:
- Write descriptive alt text for all images
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 â†’ H2 â†’ H3)
- Keep paragraphs short for web readability
- Include relevant internal and external links
