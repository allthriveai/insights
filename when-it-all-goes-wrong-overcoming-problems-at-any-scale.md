## The Reality of Large-Scale Projects

"Normal-sized" Drupal projects provide ample opportunities for failure. Enterprise projects add complexity: multiple initiatives, partners, stakeholders, and product owners across globally distributed teams.

When executing projects at scale, maintaining development velocity and efficient agile workflows becomes challenging for project managers and technical architects.

## Key Success Elements

Set yourself up for success by learning what NOT to do through real examples:

**1. Communication That Upholds Agile**
- Institute clear communication channels
- Create feedback loops preventing small issues from becoming major problems

**2. Effective Team Management** 
- Balance delivery teams, infrastructure support, and stakeholder alignment
- Maintain consistent vision across product owners

**3. Technical Best Practices**
- Standardize practices across multiple development teams
- Establish shared environments and deployment procedures

**4. Key Tools and Practices**
- Use project management tools providing team visibility
- Implement automated testing and monitoring systems

Know what to look for so you can be an educated, thoughtful leader keeping projects humming and teams happy.
